# What-I-See
*What I See* is a video simulator that recreates the visual and auditory experience of someone who has Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS), a neurological condition that affects how the brain processes visual and audio information.
Through a variety of settings, users can recreate their symptoms to better communicate their reality to others, whether itâ€™s family, friends, or health professionals. The simulator can also be used to track symptoms and pinpoint possible triggers. 

The project was created using React.js, JavaScript ES6, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.

## About VSS Page

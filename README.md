# What-I-See
What I See is a video simulator that recreates the visual and auditory experience of someone who has Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS).
Through a variety of settings, users can recreate their symptoms to better communicate their reality to others, whether itâ€™s family, friends, or health professionals.
